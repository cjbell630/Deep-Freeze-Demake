gba screen is 30 tiles wide, 20 tiles tall


Assuming I add a header and footer of 16px each (for score etc), to balance out the proportions,
Each pink tile should be ~11 pixels tall and ~30 pixels wide

Regardless, Santa should be around 2 horizontal pink things tall (~22)
and in total, including his arms and gun, he should be 
If I do this, I will need to be very careful about removing the top ~8 pixels of santa's hitbox (since I can't make 24x32 sprites)

In the original, Santa's gun does not have collision.
An easy fix for this would be to run two swuares, one for the lower ~half of his body (up to his arm), and then a slightly thinner one for the head.

OG game screen is 16 pink things tall. 
Each pink thing is slightly less than 3 times as wide as it is tall.
If initially displaying things offscreen is okay, then
hold up I messed up


pTW = tile width of pink thing
sPW = screen width in pink things

30 ~= sPW*pTW  ->  sPW ~= 30/pTW ~= 7-8
7 <= 30/pTW <= 8

One solution: pink things are 4 tiles wide, and there are 7.5 of them onscreen
(one extra tile would be on either side of the screen, not too hard to do)

pTH = tile height of pink thing
sPH = screen height in pink things

20 ~= sPH*pTW  ->  sPH ~= 20/pTH ~= 15-16
15 <= 20/pTH <= 16

One solution: add a 2 tile buffer to the top and bottom of the screen (the 20 then changes to 16)
then make each pink thing 1 tile tall, giving a 16 tile tall game screen

Santa is 2 tiles tall = 16px tall

Also backgrounds should probably be 208x160, unless I put them behind the menu buffers, in which case it would be 240x160 (fullscreen)

...there's a separate pallette bank for the background...
ookay
so
um
requantize the background into 240 colors instead of 256, save the last 16 for platforms? Ig? hmm
I will think
