# Deep-Freeze-Demake

Work in progress

You can find the current demo in either releases (working demo) or /out/Deep_Freeze_Demake.gba (possibly non-working demo).

I'll update this with proper copyright information later, but for now, credit for essentially anything here that is not code belongs to Miniclip (ie. game concept, graphics, sound, etc)

The original game can be found [here][1].
